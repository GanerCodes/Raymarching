Rotate along 3 axis
Inital rotation:
    1. Rotate a_x degrees around X axis
    2. Rotate a_y degrees around Y axis
    3. Rotate a_z degrees around Z axis

Rotational change: <P, Y, R> (pitch, yaw, roll) ["Facing" direction is +z]
a_x = apply inital rotations to (1, 0, 0)
a_y = apply inital rotations to (0, 1, 0)
a_z = apply inital rotations to (0, 0, 1)
Rotate P by P degrees on axis a_x
Rotate P by Y degrees on axis a_y
Rotate P by R degrees on axis a_z



How to rotate point P by ζ degrees around line θ, φ

0. Consider line:
    a. Init line as X axis
    b. Rotate XY by θ
    c. Rotate XZ by φ

1. Align point P:
    a. Rotate P along XZ by -φ
    b. Rotate P along XY by -θ

2. Rotate P along line axis:
    a. Rotate P along YZ by ζ

3. Reverse alignment transformation:
    a. Rotate P along XY by θ
    b. Rotate P along XZ by φ
