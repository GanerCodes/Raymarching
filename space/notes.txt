axies:
    (1, 0, 0) apply p_rot = LOC
    (0, 1, 0) apply p_rot
    (0, 0, 1) apply p_rot
AN = apply p_rot_vel on axies

M(rot) applies rotation matrix rot to axies.
find rot such that M(rot) == AN


vars:
    facing
Loc: (0, 1, 0)
Rot 1: facing direction - rotate sphere around under [XZ]
Rot 2: foward direction - rotate around perpendicular (+ 1/2π) to facing direction
Rot 3: side   direction - rotate around facing direction <cos(facing), sin(facing), 0>



How to rotate point P by ζ degrees around line θ, φ

0. Consider line:
    a. Init line as X axis
    b. Rotate XY by θ
    c. Rotate XZ by φ

1. Align point P:
    a. Rotate P along XZ by -φ
    b. Rotate P along XY by -θ

2. Rotate P along line axis:
    a. Rotate P along YZ by ζ

3. Reverse alignment transformation:
    a. Rotate P along XY by θ
    b. Rotate P along XZ by φ
