How to rotate point P by Î¶ degrees around line Î¸, Ï†

0. Consider line:
    a. Init line as X axis
    b. Rotate XY by Î¸
    c. Rotate XZ by Ï†

1. Align point P:
    a. Rotate P along XZ by -Ï†
    b. Rotate P along XY by -Î¸

2. Rotate P along line axis:
    a. Rotate P along YZ by Î¶

3. Reverse alignment transformation:
    a. Rotate P along XY by Î¸
    b. Rotate P along XZ by Ï†
